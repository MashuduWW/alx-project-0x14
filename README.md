# Review Endpoints

## Endpoint Types

- Search endpoints: e.g., search by movie title, actor name, or TV show.

- Details endpoints: Provide full information on a specific title or person (trailers, biographies, awards, cast, etc.).

- Actor endpoints: Provide actor profiles (filmography, bios).

- Utilities or metadata endpoints: Commonly used for retrieving system-wide information like available genres, languages, or other filtering facets.

The information mentioned (“Includes YouTube trailer URL, awards, full biography...”) suggests support for all these aspects.

## Error Handling 


Common Error Responses & Their Meanings

400 Bad Request	Invalid or missing parameters:  malformed URL or missing required fields like seriesId or id
401 Unauthorized Missing or invalid API key: no X-RapidAPI-Key header or using a wrong key
403 Forbidden	Access denied: your subscription plan doesn't allow access to the endpoint
404 Not Found	Resource not found: invalid or non-existent IMDb ID
429 Too Many Requests	Rate limit exceeded: sending too many requests in a short time
500 Internal Server Error	API-side error: a bug or outage on the API server

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

Usage Limitations
Rate Limits:
The API enforces rate limits based on your subscription plan. Typical free tiers allow a limited number of requests per day or per minute (e.g., 1000 requests/day or 30 requests/minute). Exceeding these limits will return a 429 Too Many Requests error.

Quota Limits:
Some plans impose monthly quotas — once reached, your API access may be suspended until the next billing cycle or upgrade.

Concurrent Requests:
The API may restrict the number of simultaneous connections to prevent overload.

Data Limits:
Some endpoints may limit the number of results returned per request (e.g., max 10 or 20 results per page).

Recommendations for Effective API Usage
Implement Pagination:
Use the page and next parameters to navigate results efficiently instead of fetching huge datasets at once.

Cache Responses:
Cache frequently requested data locally to reduce redundant API calls and stay within rate limits.

Validate Input:
Always validate and sanitize inputs (e.g., IMDb IDs) before making requests to avoid unnecessary errors.

Error Handling & Retry:
Handle errors gracefully and implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures (especially for 429 and 500 errors).

Monitor Usage:
Keep track of your API call usage in RapidAPI dashboard to avoid unexpected cutoffs.
